# LDS UI/UX Mock (React + Material UI)

This is a minimal skeleton project to mock up a page using React and Material UI.

Quick start

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start dev server:

```bash
npm start
```

The dev server will start on http://localhost:3000 by default.

Build

```bash
npm run build
```

Files added

- `src/` - React app source
- `src/components` - Header, Hero, CardGrid
- `public/index.html` - HTML template
- `webpack.config.js`, `.babelrc` - build config

Notes

- Uses Webpack + Babel for simplicity. If you prefer Vite or Create React App, I can convert it.
- Material UI (MUI v5) is used for components and theming.
